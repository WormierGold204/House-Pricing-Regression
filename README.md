    - Random Forest Regression
    - Gradient Boosting Regression
    - Tuned Random Forest Regression (via GridSearchCV)
    - Tuned Gradient Boosting Regression (via GridSearchCV)
- **Prediction**: Predict results using one of the model previously trained, manually inserting the features required.
- **Model Management**:
    - View all trained models together with their characteristics
    - Delete models
