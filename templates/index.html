    <h2 id="documentation">Information about the App</h2>
    <p>This web application is designed to predict house prices based on various features of the houses.
       It provides functionalities for training regression models, making predictions, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).</p>
    <h3>Features:</h3>
    <ul id="features-list">
        <li class="feature">Training: it is possible to train a model by giving it a name, choosing which type of regression to use
            and selecting the features on which the training will be based (the features names are the same as the columns of the dataset).</li>
        <li class="feature">Prediction: it is possible to make a prediction by selecting a model (that has already been trained)
            and providing the values for the features requested.
            It is also possible to leave some features blank, in which case the median value will be used for
            numerical features and the most frequen value for categorical features.</li>
        <li class="feature">Models: it is possible to view the models that have already been trained, and also delete them if desired.</li>
        <li class="feature">EDA: it is possible to view performed exploratory data analysis on the dataset. More information can be
            found on the EDA page.
